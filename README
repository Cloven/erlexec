=======

Execute and control OS processes from Erlang/OTP.

This project implements a C++ port program and Erlang application that gives light-weight
Erlang processes fine-grain control over execution of OS processes.

It makes possible for an Erlang process to start, stop an OS process, send POSIX signals, know
process IDs of the started OS process, set up a monitor and/or link to it. This application
provides better control over OS processes than built-in erlang:open_port/2 command with a
{spawn, Command} option, and performs proper OS child process cleanup when the emulator exits.
